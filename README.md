<p>THIS GAME HAS BEEN BEING DEVELOPED BY ME(KAAN CINAR) WHO IS OWNER OF THE THIS GIT ACCOUNT. GAME WILL BE PUBLISHED COOMING SOON ON THE MOBILE PLATFORM.</p>

<p>Both singleplayer and multiplater all platforms are generated by using DFS Algorithm. 
That's why as the player was launched the game each stage, the platform will be generated with different solution paths. 
In addition this  all events and obstacles even enemies are spawned by using some data structures. 
For example enemies uses A* algorithm to explore path without collide with events(coins , diamonds, obstacles). 
Depends on the difficulty selection , the player might be encountered either more or less obstacles, enemies e.g.

Also they can use it on this scene. In addition these they can take a review map that is placed right bottom on the screen. The platform that is consist of colorful tiles is created with DFS data structures which is means each colorful tile where is placed in the platform has unique position of places when it restart. We might be take a look with point view just like mix of the open-word and platform games. At the each init of scene , the algorithm will run and generate another unique solution and platform. In addition these , at the last stage of day , you are going to encounter with enemy that has autonomous move features. In here , this system similarity with AI , it runs A* algorithm to find new path on the platform from start to arrive point to make arrive enemy. Also the obstacles that is placed at the previous stage are placed with particular data structures. The execute order is : First one is platform manager , Second one is event manager ,  Third one is Obstacle Manager , Latest is Enemy Manager. Thus the platform had been builded complately.</p>
