<h3>Structure Of The Game</h3>
<p>Both singleplayer and multiplater all platforms are generated by using DFS Algorithm. 
That's why as the player was launched the game each stage, the platform will be generated with different solution paths. 
In addition this  all events and obstacles even enemies are spawned by using some data structures. 
For example enemies uses A* algorithm to explore path without collide with events(coins , diamonds, obstacles). 
Depends on the difficulty selection , the player might be encountered either more or less obstacles, enemies e.g.

<h3>Structure Of The Game Graphics</h3>
<p>The game is developed using Unity and utilizes the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) based on the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). 
It employs a variety of mobile-optimized shaders, including unlit shaders and custom SRP-compatible shaders written in HLSL under URP fundamentals. 
The rendering backends supported are Vulkan 1.0+ (Android 10 and above) and OpenGL 3.2+.</p>
